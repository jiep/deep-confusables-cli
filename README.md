# V2D - Visual Unicode attacks with deep learning

Unlike the classic tools for generating malicious domains (typographical errors), we have created a system to detect similar domains from Unicode. This system does not have a static table in the code with the changes but they are based on the similarity of the characters by means of Deep Learning. This provides a greater number of variations and a possible update over time.

## State of Art

This project is based on the initial idea of capturing the differences between Unicode characters through their representation in images, for which the following system of repositories has been created. This is a hard difference with others projects who use the standard of Unicode. We based on this to update our tool and try to get a better result.

Some interesting projects are:

* Standard: https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/confusables.jsp

* Personal project: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/out-of-character-use-of-punycode-and-homoglyph-attacks-to-obfuscate-urls-for-phishing


## Research

We based our tool in the last article because we think it is important to understand the problems of this type of symbols, but we use other point of view and we don't take the standard to the similar symbols because this is too old and controllated by the systems, with this variations we have a personal system to create multiple variations without restriction and we can update any of the parts of the system to get better results.

This is the schema of the system:

![Alt text](/img/Architecture.png "Repositories system.")

The first repository is that of the Unicode images, we have 38,880 characters that we will use to search from their images which are more similar to those that interest us (Basic Latin).

This is the first public database with the images of the Unicode characters, we'll like to shared it to improve the recognize images database for the community. Any can download all the images in the following repository:

![Image repository](/img/repository.png "Image repository.")

Repo: https://github.com/PantherLab/v2d-unicodeDB

The images are available for all the community to improve the algorithms to recognize characters.

To calculate the similarity between images of Unicode characters, we use Transfer Learning with [Keras](https://keras.io), all this project are available in Github:

Repo: https://github.com/PantherLab/v2d-similarity

This code extracts image features to compare and create a `confusables` file that it's used by the `CLI`.

Finally, we use the result of this repository to create a `CLI` to generate all the possible combinations with each similar letter of each letter in Unicode. As an attacker, it can be used to generate malicious web domains, emails, phishing, etc. On the other hand, as a defender, you can check if all these variations are working to block and inform.

The code is available in Github

Repo: https://github.com/PantherLab/v2d-cli

## V2D - CLI

V2D is the first tool that used Deep Learning, in special Transfer Learning, to create automatically new variations of inputs used Unicode characters, its a typical visual attack but in this case this tool use the power of the machines to select the most similar character between all possibles.
